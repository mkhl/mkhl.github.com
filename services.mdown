project-description: A Quick Search Box plugin for accessing the Services menu
---

A [Google Quick Search Box][qsb] plugin that adds support for accessing
the [Services menu][services-menu].

[qsb]: http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/ "Google Quick Search Box"
[services-menu]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Services_menu

### Usage:

* Invoke QSB.
* Find an object to perform a service with, like a file, URL, text&hellip;
* *Tab* into that object.
* Find the service you want to perform on it.
* *Enter* to invoke the selected service on the object you provided.

Services will only become available when they can accept the data QSB
would provide them.  Services that donâ€™t accept input data can of course
be invoked without providing any.
